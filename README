This is a set of little bash scripts used to monitor whatever you want and warn
you if something changes (just like Nagios http://www.nagios.org/ does, but a 
lot lot more simple).

There is a main script mininagios2.sh that executes the checks and send the 
notifications if needed.
The emails to send the notifications to and some other otions are in the config 
file.
The scripts under checks will be executed buy the main script, they must use 
those return values:

0 - OK
1 - ERROR
2 - OTHER

The main script will also capture the output and include it on the message body.

The scripts under checks/aux are auxiliar scripts used by the ones at checks, 
like port probes and process checking.


It's on an early stage, I will create more check scripts and improve the ones 
here as often as I'm able, all the help is appreciated.
